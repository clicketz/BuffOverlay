# Buff Overlay

Please report issues here: https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/buff-overlay/issues


This addon was created for people to quickly and easily see active defenses on other players so they can adjust their gameplay accordingly.


It is intended to be as lightweight as possible, and only works with the default Blizzard raid frames.


There are no in-game options, so if you wish to add a buff you will need to edit BuffOverlay.lua.


By default, all immunity and damage reduction abilities have been added.
